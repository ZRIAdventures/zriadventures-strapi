/**
 * Merchandise Lifecycle Hooks
 *
 * Note: Automatic computation disabled due to Strapi v5 draft/publish limitations.
 * Lifecycle hooks cannot persist computed field values in the draft/publish workflow.
 *
 * Alternative solutions:
 * 1. Compute on frontend when data is fetched
 * 2. Use a custom admin endpoint for manual backfill
 * 3. Use scheduled cron job for periodic computation
 * 4. Use PostgreSQL views/triggers at database level
